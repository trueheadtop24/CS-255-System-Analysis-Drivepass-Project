# CS-255-System-Analysis-Drivepass-Project

The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted to help more students pass their driving tests. 
The company needed a system that would let students take online practice tests, schedule real driving lessons, and let teachers track student progress.
I created a system that worked on phones and computers, allowed for secure login, and made it easy for students, teachers, and admins to use the features they needed.

One thing I did well was making the system simple and easy to understand.
I clearly showed how each part of the system would work for each user. If I could improve one part, I would spend more time on the user interface section to make it even more user-friendly. 
I paid close attention to what the users needed by reading the client’s requests and making sure the design matched their goals. 
It’s important to think about users because a system that’s hard to use won’t help anyone. 
In the future, I’d keep using tools like use case diagrams, class diagrams, and user feedback to make sure the software works well and helps people.
